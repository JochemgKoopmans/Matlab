MATLAB scripts
- Data preprocessing scripts that help interpret .csv output files from my Cognitive Neuroscience Master's thesis online experiments.
    - Files import each participant's .csv file, identifies trial types and sums answers per trial group (e.g. blocks, conditions) and plots sanity checks to visually inspect data quality.
There are two scripts, one for the project's pilot study and one for the main study. Unfortunately, I cannot make the raw data files available because they contain participants' personal information.
